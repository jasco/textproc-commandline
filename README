Text is everywhere but not always in a useful form.  On any given day we
encounter dozens or hundreds of data formats.  Some formats are focused on
presentation while others focus on structure at the expense of presentation.
Many times the information we need has to be found, disentangled and
manipulated before it is useful.  The easier we can navigate across these
boundaries, the more freedom we have to find new uses and insights.

Linux offers a rich array of commands and tools for text processing at the
command line.  This talk proposes a classification for different types of
command line processing tasks and then explores some of the common tools
available within each category.  Many of these tools have a host of options.
Some useful but lesser known options will be highlighted.
